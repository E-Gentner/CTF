2Warm is another challenged focused on translating number bases
This one it asks you to convert 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2) 

<h1> |Solution| </h1>
Translating to or from binary is not easiest thing but also not too difficult once you do it a couple times
Because binary counts in base 2 it goes from 0-1-2-4-8-16-32... which are the only numbers that we need for this problem 
When you count a binary byte you start from the right being 1 or 0 and then move left.
So, in order to get to 42 you need 32, 8, and 2, which is how you get 101010
