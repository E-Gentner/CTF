Python Wrangling starts with a python file and password text and you then need to find the key by using the two together

<h1> |Solution|</h1>
The solution involves some basic python knowlegde
you need to download all the files in the webshell or on your own machine
Then you can either run 'man python' to get an understanding of how to run the python file.
Once you have an understanding of how to run the script you will run 'python ende.py -d flag.txt.en'
this allows it to run the script in its decrypt mode and use the "flag.txt.en' and gives you the flag.
