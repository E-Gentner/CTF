Wave a Flag starts off by having you download a biary for a program called warm

<h1> |Solution| </h1>
The first soltion I came across was to use the 'cat' command to display the contents of the file
In turn this revealed the flag that was inside the binary

The intentional solution is to give the file executable permissions by using 'chmod +x warm'
You then do './warm' and it will tell you to add a -h to get help for the file which then reveals the flag
